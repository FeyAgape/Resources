With heat mapping there are a few that provide this service, 3 that look decent are:
•	https://mouseflow.com/
•	https://www.hotjar.com
•	https://www.inspectlet.com/
 
They do heat mapping and also record a video of each user on the site so you can see where their mouse went and what they entered in boxes etc…  There is a free plan with each of them, the paid for plans have more detailed analytics and more features.
 
With the eye tracking there are quite a few, here are some of them:
•	https://www.eyesdecide.com/
•	https://www.realeye.io/
•	https://www.sticky.ai/
 
The problem is there are no sites currently let you test live websites, you can only test in dev environments… so you upload your content to the site and then you have certain users test out those sites.  There is only one site which is saying live website testing coming soon: https://www.eyesdecide.com/pricing/ at the bottom of that page.
